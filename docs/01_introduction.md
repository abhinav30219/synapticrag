# Introduction

## Background

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing RAG approaches often face challenges in handling complex queries, maintaining context coherence, and managing multi-modal content effectively.

## Motivation

Recent advances in RAG architectures, particularly LightRAG and MemoRAG, have shown promising directions for improvement:

- LightRAG demonstrates the effectiveness of graph-based knowledge representation and retrieval
- MemoRAG introduces memory-guided retrieval for better context understanding
- Both approaches, however, have limitations in handling multi-modal content and complex semantic relationships

## SynapticRAG Overview

SynapticRAG is a novel hybrid RAG system that combines and extends the strengths of both LightRAG and MemoRAG while introducing several key innovations:

1. **Hybrid Text Processing**:
   - Two-stage chunking combining semantic and token-based approaches
   - Language-aware processing with optimized chunk sizes
   - Improved context preservation through strategic overlap

2. **Multi-modal Support**:
   - Integrated CLIP model for image understanding
   - Unified embedding space for text and images
   - Cross-modal retrieval capabilities

3. **Enhanced Knowledge Graph**:
   - Graph-based knowledge representation
   - Memory-guided relationship extraction
   - Dynamic graph updates with new information

4. **Flexible Storage Architecture**:
   - FAISS vector stores for efficient similarity search
   - NetworkX graph storage for relationship management
   - JSON KV storage for metadata and caching

## Key Contributions

1. A novel hybrid architecture combining graph-based and memory-guided retrieval
2. An improved text chunking strategy that preserves both semantic meaning and token-level context
3. Multi-modal support with unified embedding space for text and images
4. State-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and domains
5. Enhanced scalability and maintainability through modular design
